Let your readers become your eyez

== Description ==

= Add a Photobox to the story =
A Photobox is a curated collection of photos, uploaded by the crowd to enrich the story and provide different points of view. It is a new way to engage with your audience and start a direct visual discussion on your site.

= Publish Photo-rich content =
Let your readers add authentic photos directly to your story. Open the door for your audience and let them bring their own perspective and visual voice to the heart of the topics that matter.

= Empower Meaningful Engagement =
It’s no secret that visual storytelling is the leading trend in the content industry. We cannot even imagine hitting ‘Publish’ without including an image in our stories. Spark interest through the eyez of your readers, let them go behind the scenes and surprise with their take on the story.

= Curation is addictive =
We make it easy and fun for you to publish only the relevant photos. Curate from anywhere and get full control to set the tone and lead the visual dialog.

Publishing compelling visual stories has never been easier:
* Open a Photobox
* Embed in your story
* Publish relevant photos

= Visual Storytelling Plugin =
The million eyez plugin automatically sets your featured photo according to the embedded Photobox. It will also set your open graph image so sharing a post on social networks will display the featured photo.

Adding the plugin to your site will save you hours of searching for photos.
Just add a million eyez Photobox, sit back and enjoy a variety of amazing photos uploaded especially for your content.
